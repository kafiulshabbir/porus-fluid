The algorithms and methods used to simulate two-phase flow in porous media has many practical applications in oil recovery, hydrology, electricity production where pressurized water is passed through heated pipes and is transformed into steam, etc. The model and algorithm presented here is used to find the saturation of a phase with respect to time and model imbibition.

[NEED to add - all other similar models, what these models have achieved, and how this model is different from them]
