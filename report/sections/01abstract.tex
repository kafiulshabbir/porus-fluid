Simulation of two-phase flow in porous media has applications in oil recovery, hydrology, electricity production where pressurized water is passed through heated pipes and is transformed into steam, etc. The model and algorithm presented here is used to find the saturation of a phase with respect to time and model imbibition. The flow rate when a tube contain meniscus after necessary derivation is given by a modified Poiseuilleâ€™s equation. This produces n linear equations for a model with n nodes. The pressures at each node are the variables. Gaussian-elimination is used to solve the linear equations. Then the time step is decided and each meniscus in the tubes is displaced. The wetting fluid is distributed first in ascending order of the radius of the tubes. After this if there are more than two meniscus in a tube, the phases are combined such that the center of mass of the phases remain the same. The results show that the wetting fluid indeed enters the region with thinner radius.
