This algorithm can be extended to the case where there are more than 4 tubes connected to a node, since for two phase flow into a node case, we distribute in an ascending order of radii, in our model it is distributed to a maximum number to two tubes, but for hexagonal model it can be 4. We only need to update the function which produces the connections. The same model can be used for a 3-dimensional case, where one surface has higher pressure than the opposite surface which has a lower pressure, it is to be used in order to more accurately represent the porous body.

6. In the conclusions, among other things, promise to continue the work. The ultimate goal is to verify the Kondaurov model, determine the physical meaning of the coefficients of this model, and the scope of its applicability.
