Simulation of two-phase flow in porous media has many applications in oil recovery, hydrology, electricity production, etc. Classical continuum models consider permeability to be a function of only saturation. Classical continuum models are unable to explain non-equilibrium effects.

Advanced continuum models, such as the Kondaurov model considers permeability to be a function of a non-equilibrium parameter in addition to saturation. In order to better understand the non-equilibrium effects, it is necessary to develop non-continuum models at the scale of the pores, for example a network model.

This article is about the network model of two-phase flow in porous media which we developed, using which the saturation of the wetting phase with respect to time in the region of finer pores was calculated. A novel method for distributing phases at the nodes was used. According to the results obtained, the saturation rests to an equilibrium value. 

The final objective of our research is to develop a network model in order to understand the physical meaning of the Kondaurov non-equilibrium parameter.
