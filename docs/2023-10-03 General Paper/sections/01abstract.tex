This article is about a network model of two-phase flow in porous media which uses a novel method of distributing different phases in the nodes. In our simulation we measured the saturation of the a phase with respect to time in the region of finer pores. We observed that the saturation rests to an equilibrium value. 

Simulation of two-phase flow in porous media has many applications in oil recovery, hydrology, electricity production, etc. Classical continuum models consider permeability to be a function of only saturation. Classical continuum models are unable to explain non-equilibrium effects. Advanced continuum models, such as the Kondaurov model considers permeability to be a function of a non-equilibrium parameter in addition to saturation. In order to better understand the non-equilibrium effects, it is necessary to develop non-continuum models at the scale of the pores, for example a network model.

The objective of our research is to develop a network model which helps us better understand the Kondaurov non-equilibrium parameter.
