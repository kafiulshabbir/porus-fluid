	Our objective is to model imbibition. In figure \label{fig:invasion-result1}, all of the wetting fluid is located in the outer region, which has thicker radius. The inner region is filled with non-wetting fluid. In this simulation we wish to analyze the saturation of cyan fluid in the inner region with respect to time, $S = S(t)$. The features of the system are:
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The boundaries are closed.
		\item The radius in the outer region is 3 times larger, $R_{outer} = 3 * R_{inner}$.
		\item The size of the system is 26 x 26 tubes.
		\item Initially the volumes of wetting and non-wetting fluids in the whole system are equal. $V_{w} = V_{nw}$
	\end{itemize}
	
\subsection{Experiment} \label{sec:exp-main}
	The algorithm was implemented in C++ 17, compiled using gcc 9.4.0. The computation was performed using processor 11th Gen Intel Core i5-1135G7 @ 2.40GHz operating with Ubuntu 20.04 LTS. The program was not paralleled, hence only one core of the processor was used at a time.  The simulation was done for 20,000 steps. Visualization of meniscus configuration and a plot point of saturation $S(t)$ was made for every 200 steps. It took about 1 minute to compile the whole program, and 5 minutes to simulate. If only the radius or initial meniscus configurations are changed, then recompiling is not required. The node located in the center of the system was chosen to have zero pressure. It was observed that changing the node which will have 0 pressure does not change the geometry of the flow.

	The plots are not symmetric because small random values $\Delta R / R ~ 10^{-3}$ was introduced to the system. The cyan fluid has invaded from the corners. We decided to plot for $26 x 26$ because a network model of this size can be easily simulated on a personal computer in a short time, and also it satisfies the conditions of gray and cyan fluids having about equal volumes, and the inner radius being 3 times thinner than the outer radius.
	
	The the part of the program slowing down the simulation is the solution of the linear equations using Gaussian-elimination. The process of Gaussian-elimination was not optimized. Hence, if we have $m$ variables, the time complexity for solution is $m^3$. If our network model is of size $n x n$ tubes, then the number of nodes is in the order of $n^2$. Therefore the time to compute grows with the size of the network model in the order of $n^6$. If we doubled the size of the network model, it would take $2^6 = 64$ times longer to perform the same simulation, which is about 5 hours on a personal computer, still reasonable time.
	
	For implementing the algorithm, $double$ is recommended over $float$. $float$ was earlier used to speed up the process by about $2$ times, however the errors grew significantly. The saturation is supposed to remain same due to closed boundaries, but it differed by as much as $10\%$ by the end of the simulation. The error in terms of volume of one of the fluid differing was less than $1\%$ when $double$ was used.
	
\subsection{Discussion} \label{sec:exp-discussion}
	\begin{figure}[H]

	\end{figure}
	
	The equilibrium saturation for wetting fluid, $S_{eq} = 0.57$ for the inner region. For different viscosity ratio ${\mu}_1 / {\mu_2}$, the shape of the plot of $S(t)$ does not significantly differ. Changing constants of the experiment such as $\mu, \sigma, l$ simply changes the scale of the $x-axis$. Since the experiment was not calibrated to actual values, we decided to present our result in dimensionless time. It is obtained by simply diving the values on the $x-axis$ by the maximum.
	
	In in $S(t)$ plot of cyan fluid in the inner region. Initially the rate of invasion accelerates at a high rate, then the acceleration slows down, and finally the saturation reaches an equilibrium value which shows only irregular small oscillations. These irregular oscillations is expected to disappear on using a larger network model. They occur to the blocks of wetting fluid remaining in the outer region.
	
	The invasion of cyan fluid occurred from the corners, because in the corners each node is subjected to capillary forces more than from the middle of the edges. And the gray fluid was pushed out from the middle of the edges. The flow stops because of a large number of tubes ending up with 2 menisci. Tubes with two meniscus have a zero net capillary pressure, and cannot initiate flows. 
	
	$S(t)$ approximately shows a logarithmic dependence. It is clear that the relaxation parameter $\xi$ can be applied here the saturation converges to an equilibrium value. [Comment how to write the differential equation of Kondaurov.]
